# ARCHITECTURE.md

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 18. Local dev (`npm run dev`) runs on Turbopack (`next dev --turbopack`, ADR-17) to shrink dev-only on-demand route-compile latency; `build`/`start` are unchanged and still use Next's default production bundler.
- **Auth**: NextAuth v4, credentials provider (email/password, bcrypt), JWT session strategy (see `DECISIONS.md` ADR-1).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase-hosted), accessed via Prisma.
- **Market data**: Yahoo Finance (`yahoo-finance2`), NewsAPI.
- **AI**: Google Gemini (`@google/generative-ai`) for news-sentiment scoring and daily portfolio insights.
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives (via `components/ui/*`, shadcn-derived), two purpose-built inline-SVG charts — `components/portfolio-chart.tsx` (dashboard hero, see ADR-10; as of `plans/2026-07-18-meridian-dashboard-detail-fixes.md` also has hover crosshair+tooltip and y-axis price labels, ported from the detail chart's approach) and `components/research/detail-price-chart.tsx` (research-detail Overview/Technical charts, see ADR-11: hover crosshair+tooltip, minimal y-axis labels, optional dashed reference lines; no range-morph — the one behavior still exclusive to the detail chart, along with its variable viewBox). Recharts (`recharts` package) is no longer used anywhere in the app — `components/price-chart.tsx` was the last caller and was deleted once no importer remained (ADR-11); the dependency itself was removed from `package.json` 2026-07-18 (`plans/2026-07-18-performance-audit-remediation.md` Task 8, `TECH_DEBT.md` TD-30 Resolved). `next/font/google` (Libre Franklin, Newsreader — self-hosted), `next-themes` (light/dark persistence), `lucide-react` icons. `@tremor/react` was never the charting library and was removed from `package.json` in the same pass (TD-30). Design system: `DESIGN.md` (Meridian — see ADR-8/9/10/11/12).
- **Client state/data**: React Query for server-state caching; local `useState` elsewhere. (`zustand` was an unused dependency, removed 2026-07-18 — see `TECH_DEBT.md` TD-16 Resolved.) As of `plans/2026-07-18-performance-audit-remediation.md` (Task 1), the `QueryClient` in `components/providers.tsx` no longer sets a global `refetchInterval` — every query previously refetched every 30s regardless of staleness. Per-query `staleTime` is now the explicit knob (5min on research/wishlist reference-data queries, e.g. `technical-analysis.tsx`, `detail-price-chart.tsx`, the research-detail ownership query); portfolio price liveness is retained via `usePriceSync`'s own 5-min sync, not a global poll.
- **Caching**: in-memory (`node-cache` in `news.service.ts`; a separate hand-rolled `Map` in `market-data.service.ts`; another separate `Map` in `rate-limit.ts`; as of Task 3 above, a fourth keyed `Map` in `technical-analysis.service.ts` memoizing computed indicators per symbol, 60s TTL matching the underlying history cache) plus DB-backed 24h caches on `FundamentalData`/`AnalystRating`. No shared/external cache (e.g. Redis) — see ADR-4.

## Request flow

1. `middleware.ts` gates all page routes (not `/api/*`) using NextAuth's `getToken()` — unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`; authenticated users on `/login`/`/register` are redirected to `/dashboard`. This is the **sole** enforcement point for page-route auth: `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` is a synchronous Server Component with no session check of its own (ADR-16, `plans/2026-07-19-meridian-nav-responsiveness.md`) — it previously duplicated the middleware's check via a render-blocking `await getServerSession()`, which froze the entire dashboard subtree (including the shared `<Navigation>` and every route's `loading.tsx` Suspense fallback) on every intra-group navigation. Removing it changed no observable auth behaviour, only removed a redundant blocking wait.
2. Every `/api/*` route handler authorises itself — either via the shared helpers in `lib/utils/auth.ts` (`getAuthenticatedUser()`, `getAuthenticatedUserWithPortfolio()`) or an inline `getServerSession(authOptions)` check (see ADR-2 and `AGENT.md` fragile surfaces for the inconsistency between the two patterns).
3. Route handlers delegate business logic to `lib/services/*.service.ts` (see ADR-3); routes stay thin.
4. Services call Prisma for persistence/caching and external APIs (Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI, Gemini) for live data.

## Data model (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

- `User` 1:1 `Portfolio`, 1:1 `Wishlist`, 1:many `PortfolioInsight`.
- `Portfolio` 1:many `Position`, 1:many `Transaction`.
- `Position` 1:many `Transaction` (nullable `positionId` FK).
- `Wishlist` 1:many `WishlistItem`.
- Symbol-keyed, user-independent shared market-data cache tables: `FundamentalData`, `AnalystRating`, `IndustryComparison`, `NewsArticle`, `SentimentHistory`.
- No `ClosedPosition` model — closed positions are computed on every request via FIFO matching of `Transaction` rows (`app/api/portfolio/closed-positions/route.ts`).
- `User` 1:1 `UserScoringPreferences` (`plans/2026-07-20-configurable-scoring-weights.md`, ADR-20/21) — stores per-user composite category weights and fundamental subcategory weights as ten discrete nullable `Float` columns (raw values, normalized at scoring time by `lib/utils/scoring-weights.ts`). The composite score is reweighted client-side in `components/overview.tsx` (and identically in `lib/services/wishlist.service.ts`, the second consumer — both call the same shared `weightedCompositeTotal`); the fundamental score is reweighted server-side by passing the user's weights into `fetchFundamentals(symbol, weights?)` — the on-read reweight is never written back, so `FundamentalData` stays user-independent (ADR-4/ADR-21). **The migration (`prisma/migrations/20260720220007_user_scoring_preferences`) is additive-only and owner-gated** — generated via `prisma migrate dev --create-only`, confirmed pending (not applied) by `prisma migrate status`. Until the owner runs `prisma migrate deploy`, `GET`/`PUT /api/settings/scoring-weights` and the per-user reweight paths will fail against the live (shared dev/prod) database even though the code and regenerated Prisma Client are complete.

| `lib/services/exchange-rate.service.ts` | FX rate fetch/cache/convert |
| `components/error-boundary.tsx` | `ErrorBoundary` (full-page, currently unused) and `ComponentErrorBoundary` (section-level, used on dashboard, position-detail, and research-detail pages) |
| `components/research/*` | Shared Meridian research-detail primitives (ADR-11): `headline-score-card.tsx`, `score-figure.tsx` (`ScoreFigure`/`VerdictStamp`), `subscore-band.tsx`, `graded-metric-row.tsx`, `detail-price-chart.tsx`, `transactions-tab.tsx`. Consumed by `overview.tsx`, `technical-analysis.tsx`, `fundamental-analysis.tsx`, `analyst-ratings.tsx`, `intrinsic-value.tsx`, `news-feed.tsx`. As of `plans/2026-07-19-positions-tab.md` (ADR-18), `transactions-tab.tsx` (rendering the tab now labeled "Positions") is also consumed directly by `app/(dashboard)/portfolio/[ticker]/page.tsx`, not just `research/[symbol]/page.tsx` — it is the single shared body for both routes' position-detail tab. The legacy `components/transaction-history.tsx` (a stock-shadcn `Card`/`Table`/`Badge` pattern) is deleted; it has no remaining importer. |
| `lib/utils/score-band.ts` | Pure score/metric-grade banding helpers (`scoreBandClass`, `gradingDotClass`, `metricGrade`) shared across the research-detail tabs — presentational only, never changes scoring math |
| `lib/utils/chart-ticks.ts` | Pure `niceYTicks()` helper for `DetailPriceChart`'s minimal y-axis labels |
| `lib/utils/research-scores.ts` | Pure `upsideToScore`/`sentimentToScore`/`round1` derivations shared by Overview, Intrinsic value, and News & sentiment tabs; `verdictLabel(score, context)` selects the composite-verdict label set (portfolio vs wishlist wording) — used by `overview.tsx`, whose own `context` prop is now driven by an ownership lookup in `research/[symbol]/page.tsx` rather than hardcoded (MRD-Q1) |
| `lib/utils/positions-tab.ts` | Pure `shouldShowPositionsTab(transactions)` (has-or-had-a-position tab-visibility gate), `getPositionsPanelState(position)` (`"held"`/`"closed"`/`"none"` — gates the Positions tab's live stat band on `quantity > 0` specifically, not on position-record presence), and `hasRealizedPL(realizedPL)` (hide-when-exactly-zero-or-absent gate for the Realized P/L cell/caption, both states) shared by `research/[symbol]/page.tsx`, `portfolio/[ticker]/page.tsx`, and `transactions-tab.tsx` (ADR-18) |
| `lib/utils/scoring-weights.ts` | Pure `DEFAULT_SCORING_WEIGHTS` + `normalizeWeights`/`normalizeCompositeWeights`/`normalizeFundamentalWeights`/`weightedCompositeTotal`/`weightedFundamentalTotal`/`weightsEqualDefaults` (`plans/2026-07-20-configurable-scoring-weights.md`, ADR-20/21) — the single source of truth for scoring-weight math, imported by the client composite (`components/overview.tsx`), the wishlist composite (`lib/services/wishlist.service.ts`), the server fundamental path (`lib/services/fundamental-analysis.service.ts`, both its per-user reweight and its own default-weighted total), and the two Headline-score-card "Your weighting" meta-kicker comparisons (`overview.tsx`, `fundamental-analysis.tsx`) |
| `lib/services/scoring-preferences.service.ts` | `getWeights`/`saveWeights` — reads/writes `UserScoringPreferences`, coalescing null columns (and a missing row) to `DEFAULT_SCORING_WEIGHTS`; consumed by `app/api/settings/scoring-weights/route.ts` (GET/PUT) and directly by `app/api/market/fundamentals/[symbol]/route.ts` and `wishlist.service.ts` (ADR-3: pure business logic, no auth — the route/callers do auth/pass `userId`) |
| `lib/services/realized-pl.service.ts` | FIFO lot-matching + realized-P/L math shared by the sell route and the closed-positions route (AUD-03/AUD-FIX-01/03); as of ADR-18 also exports `computePositionRealizedPL(transactions, avgCostBasis)`, which sums realized P/L across one position's SELL transactions for `GET /api/portfolio/positions/[ticker]` — `Position` has no persisted per-position `realizedPL` column, only `Portfolio.realizedPL` (a portfolio-wide accumulator), so this is computed on read, not stored |

## API surface

23 route files under `app/api`. See `AGENT.md` conventions for the auth-guard pattern new routes should follow. Full enumeration is not duplicated here — read `app/api/**/route.ts` directly; the tree is shallow and each file is short.

Two routes are intentionally public, with no auth guard — every other route requires an authenticated session:
- `api/auth/[...nextauth]` — the NextAuth handler itself; it *is* the auth mechanism, so it can't require a session.
- `api/auth/register` — new-account creation; a session can't exist yet at registration time.

## Environment separation

Dev and production currently point at the same Supabase database (confirmed by the owner, 2026-07-16) — this is a single-instance limitation, not separate dev/prod instances. See `TECH_DEBT.md` (TD-02).

`DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` are two connection strings to that *same* database, serving different purposes simultaneously (not selected by network, as an earlier version of this doc stated — see ADR-6):
- `DATABASE_URL` — transaction-mode pooler (port 6543, `pgbouncer=true`), used by Prisma Client at runtime.
- `DIRECT_URL` — session-mode pooler (port 5432), required by `prisma migrate`/`prisma db push`, which need prepared-statement support that transaction-mode pooling doesn't provide.

Both must be set in `.env`/`.env.local` (see `.env.example`) or migrations will fail on a fresh clone.
